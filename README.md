# Warning
This needs a lot more testing before it can be truely considered "safe".

I tried to be conservative, especially closer to the main world (see constants) but you should back up your save and double-check any important areas after running this

## Other uses
This should also be adapatable to respawn essense eaters, music boxes, etc, might also need to delete area/entity/png_petri files for that chunk
